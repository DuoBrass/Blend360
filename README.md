# Machine Performance Analysis

## Key Question
**"What can you tell me about my machine performance?"**

This project explores machine sensor data to assess performance, identify patterns in failures, and build predictive models that can support preventive maintenance.

---

## Project Summary

- **Dataset:** `sample_interview_dataset.csv`
- **Size:** 10,000 entries Ã— 10 features
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Key Techniques:**  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  - Time-based failure trend analysis  
  - Data quality checks  
  - Random Forest classification

---

## Insights

- Sensor readings (torque, rotational speed, tool wear) influence failure risk.
- Time-based patterns indicate increasing error rates for certain machines.
- Predictive modeling enables early identification of high-risk operational states.
